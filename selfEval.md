# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

- I'm always shocked when i push through and put in the hours to try and figure out how to solve the assignments. Now, i may not always get the right answer but i'm personally proud for not giving up after feeling defeated.

- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?

- functions are a powerful tool to master because it helps to not repeat codes over and over again. When you create a function you are able to call that code to do certain tasks without creating multiple similar codes.
